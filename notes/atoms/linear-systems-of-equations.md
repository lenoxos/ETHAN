# Linear Systems of Equations (LSE)

## Definitions

**n-tuple**
> The solution of a LSE is an **n-tuple** $(x_1, ..., x_n)$
> of numbers that satisfy all $m$ equations of the system.

**General solution**
> The set of solutions (LÃ¶sungsmenge) of the systems is called the **general solution of the system**.

**equivalence**
> Two LSE are **equivalent** if they have the same set of solutions.

**inconsistency**
> A LGS is **inconsistent** when it has no solution.
e.g.
$$
x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 \\
3x_1 + 6x_2 = 8 \\
$$

**eindeutig loesbar**
> A LGS is **eindeutig loesbar** when is has exactly one solution.
e.g.
$$
x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 \\
x_1 + x_2 = 3 \\
$$

**mehrdeutig loesbar**
> A LGS is **mehrdeutig loesbar** when is has more than one solution.
e.g.
$$
x_1 + 2x_2 = 4 \\\\
2x_1 + 4x_2 = 8 \\\\
$$
